  background: `Hi there. I am a self-taught developer who loves JavaScript. I decided I wanted to do web development because I like to build things. From writing the HTML markup to deploying the app, it's an enjoyable experience knowing that I built something great that works!\nOutside of web development, I enjoy riding the trails with my mountain bike and like exploring new restaurants. I like to jam to EDM, specifically vocal trance. Lastly, I am the father of an adorable green-cheeked conure.`,
